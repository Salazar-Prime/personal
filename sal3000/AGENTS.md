# PanePilot Agent Guide

This document is the durable product and engineering handoff for PanePilot (the package is still named `project-console`). Read it before changing the application. It records the core product decisions made with the owner, the current implementation, important invariants, and the intended path for adding project types beyond terminals.

## Product purpose

PanePilot is a desktop control center for projects that are worked on by people and LLM agents. It should answer, at a glance:

- What projects exist locally and on each SSH host?
- Which agents are working, waiting, finished with a response, or blocked?
- Which terminal or conversation needs the user's attention?
- What did Codex or Claude previously say and what did the user answer?
- Which files and GitHub repository belong to a project?

The application is intentionally a single desktop UI:

- A top bar for project-type selection, project identity, and global actions.
- A toggleable left sidebar for connections, projects, terminals, and attention state.
- A type-specific main workspace.
- A bottom status bar for cross-project agent counts.

The current implementation supports only terminal projects. Writing projects were part of the original vision but are deliberately not implemented yet.

## Confirmed product decisions

These are owner-approved decisions and should be treated as product invariants unless explicitly changed:

1. A project has a stable identity independent of its display name.
2. A terminal project is tied to one folder and one connection.
3. A connection is either the local machine or an SSH alias imported from `~/.ssh/config`.
4. Projects are grouped by connection in the sidebar.
5. Subprojects are not part of the product. Legacy `parent_id` values are flattened during database migration.
6. A project may have multiple terminal sessions.
7. Terminals appear both as tabs in the main workspace and as direct-jump items under their project in the sidebar.
8. Persistent terminals use tmux when available. A plain PTY is the fallback.
9. Supported launch profiles are login shell, Codex, Claude Code, and a custom command.
10. Dangerous permission bypass is per terminal, off by default, visibly marked, and confirmed before launch. It must never become a silent global default.
11. Terminal rename is non-destructive. Archive hides a stopped terminal but preserves its saved output. Permanent deletion requires a stopped terminal and confirmation.
12. Deleting a terminal does not delete the provider's Codex or Claude conversation archive.
13. Local Codex and Claude archives are indexed read-only and are searchable across full message text.
14. File-looking terminal output should be clickable. Files can also be browsed and previewed in the UI.
15. A GitHub repository action is available when a Git remote can be discovered.
16. Agent lifecycle state should come from provider hooks when available, not from fragile terminal-screen parsing.

## Agent lifecycle semantics

Agent state describes the current turn, not merely whether the terminal process exists.

| State | Meaning | Expected UI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `idle` | Codex or Claude is open and ready, but no turn is running. | Neutral dot; no attention badge. |
| `running` | The user submitted a prompt and the agent is generating or using tools. | Animated working indicator. |
| `needs-input` | The agent asked a direct question, requested confirmation, or opened a permission prompt. | Amber dot, `!` attention badge, and response input in the terminal workspace. |
| `response-ready` | The latest response finished without requiring an answer. | Blue response-ready dot. |
| `needs-attention` | The run hit a condition that needs intervention. | Red attention state. |
| `completed` | The terminal process/session was intentionally ended. | Completed state; terminal can be archived or deleted. |
| `error` | The terminal or agent ended with an error. | Error state; terminal can be archived or deleted. |

Important lifecycle rules:

- A new Codex or Claude terminal starts as `idle`, not `running`.
- Startup rendering must not mark an agent as working.
- `UserPromptSubmit` changes the state to `running`.
- Provider `Stop` examines `last_assistant_message`:
  - A direct trailing question or explicit confirmation request becomes `needs-input`.
  - Otherwise it becomes `response-ready`.
- `PermissionRequest` always becomes `needs-input`.
- Claude `Notification` events for `permission_prompt` and `idle_prompt` become `needs-input`.
- `needs-input` is sticky. It must not be replaced by an unrelated `Stop` or screen update. It clears only when terminal input is submitted or a later structured event proves execution continued.
- An open shell terminal must never cause an LLM-specific working indicator.
- `completed` means the terminal ended. It does not mean merely that one answer finished.

State priority when several visible sessions exist is:

`needs-input` → `needs-attention` → `running` → `response-ready` → `idle` → `error` → `completed`.

## Current architecture

PanePilot is an Electron application using React, TypeScript, SQLite, xterm, node-pty, and tmux.

### Process boundaries

- `src/main/`: trusted Electron main process, SQLite, PTYs, tmux, SSH, archive indexing, filesystem access, and lifecycle events.
- `src/preload/index.ts`: narrow IPC bridge exposed as `window.projectConsole`.
- `src/renderer/`: React UI. It must not access Node APIs directly.
- `src/shared/types.ts`: contracts shared across the three layers.

Every new capability that crosses the Electron boundary must be updated in all of these places:

1. Shared input/output types.
2. Main-process IPC handler.
3. Preload bridge.
4. `src/renderer/env.d.ts`.
5. Renderer consumer.

### Important files

- `src/renderer/components/App.tsx`: application shell, connection/project sidebar, project header, History UI, and Files UI.
- `src/renderer/components/ManagedTerminal.tsx`: xterm lifecycle, terminal tabs, launcher, rename/archive/delete UI, dangerous mode, and response input.
- `src/main/terminal-manager.ts`: PTY/tmux lifecycle, persistence, SSH attachment, state transitions, and terminal operations.
- `src/main/remote-agent-hooks.ts`: additive SSH-host hook bootstrap and remote event bridge.
- `src/main/remote-agent-event-follower.ts`: reconnecting SSH follower for remote lifecycle event spools.
- `src/main/ssh-connection.ts`: app-owned SSH multiplexing options and short, protected control-socket location.
- `src/main/store.ts`: SQLite schema, migrations, project/session/activity persistence, and aggregate state.
- `src/main/agent-event-monitor.ts`: consumes provider hook JSONL and maps lifecycle events into terminal states.
- `src/main/conversation-indexer.ts`: read-only Codex/Claude JSONL discovery, parsing, caching, and full-text search.
- `src/main/file-service.ts`: bounded local file listing and previews.
- `src/main/remote-file-service.ts`: SSH-backed file listing and previews.
- `src/main/ssh-config.ts`: SSH alias discovery.
- `src/main/git.ts`: repository URL discovery.
- `scripts/agent-event-hook.mjs`: no-op-outside-PanePilot hook bridge.
- `scripts/install-agent-hooks.mjs`: additive user-level hook installer with backups.

### Storage

The database is:

`~/Library/Application Support/project-console/project-console.sqlite`

Core tables:

- `connections`: local or SSH connection identities.
- `projects`: base project identity, type, connection, folder, repository URL, aggregate state, and timestamps.
- `terminal_sessions`: terminal profile, command, backend, tmux identity, lifecycle state, dangerous-mode flag, archive flag, and saved output.
- `activities`: project timeline entries.
- `agent_events`: idempotently ingested provider lifecycle payloads.

The old `projects.parent_id` column remains for migration compatibility but is unused and cleared on startup.

Do not put type-specific data into many nullable columns on `projects`. New project types should use their own table keyed by `project_id`.

## Terminal persistence and output

- Local and remote sessions use tmux when it is available.
- Each PanePilot terminal has its own tmux session name.
- Closing/detaching the renderer does not kill a persistent tmux session.
- A PTY fallback is used when tmux cannot be found or created.
- Local tmux resolution checks PATH plus common Homebrew/system locations.
- Custom hook environment variables must be passed through the pane's initial `env` command. A pre-existing tmux server does not automatically import arbitrary client variables.
- Saved terminal output is capped in SQLite.
- xterm replay must suppress `onData`; otherwise xterm protocol replies can be echoed into the PTY as numeric garbage.
- Raw PTY output must remain byte-for-byte intact. Remote lifecycle data travels over a separate SSH follower and must never be mixed into terminal output.

Archive and deletion rules:

- Only `completed` or `error` terminals can be archived or deleted.
- Archived terminals are hidden from normal tabs/sidebar lists but can be restored.
- Permanent deletion removes saved terminal output and associated ingested hook events.
- Provider-owned conversation JSONL is never removed by terminal deletion.

## Codex and Claude lifecycle hooks

The hook installer adds lifecycle handlers to:

- `~/.codex/hooks.json`
- `~/.claude/settings.json`

It preserves existing configuration and creates `.project-console-backup` files. The bridge is inert unless all PanePilot session variables exist:

- `PROJECT_CONSOLE_SESSION_ID`
- `PROJECT_CONSOLE_PROVIDER`
- `PROJECT_CONSOLE_EVENT_FILE`

Events are appended to:

`~/Library/Application Support/project-console/agent-events/<terminal-session-id>.jsonl`

The monitor deduplicates them through `agent_events`.

Codex may require the user to review the hook once with `/hooks`, both locally and on an SSH host. Do not silently add `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`; that would bypass trust for every enabled hook, not only PanePilot's hook.

For remote Codex and Claude sessions:

- The renderer asks once per SSH connection before allowing PanePilot to modify that host's user-level hook settings.
- The first approved agent launch additively installs `~/.panepilot/agent-event-hook.sh` and updates `~/.codex/hooks.json` and `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- Existing settings are preserved and one-time `.project-console-backup` files are created.
- The remote bootstrap requires Python 3 for safe JSON merging. If setup fails, the terminal still opens and prints a warning, but only terminal-output fallback tracking is available.
- Remote tmux and PTY shells receive PanePilot lifecycle environment variables explicitly.
- The hook spools base64 events under `~/.panepilot/events/`.
- Remote terminals use an app-owned OpenSSH control socket in a short, per-user, mode-0700 directory under `/tmp` (the macOS socket path limit makes the longer app-data path unsafe). A separate BatchMode follower reuses that authenticated connection to tail the spool, then writes normalized local event records for `AgentEventMonitor`.
- The follower retries while interactive SSH authentication is still in progress and replays the spool after reconnection. Event IDs are stable hashes, so replay is idempotent.
- Only sessions created after remote tracking was installed and environment injection was added can emit structured lifecycle events.

Remote Codex and Claude conversation archive ingestion remains future work.

## Dangerous agent mode

Dangerous mode uses:

- Codex: `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`
- Claude: `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

Safety invariants:

- Off by default for every launch.
- Per-terminal choice, never a global preference.
- Confirmation immediately before launch.
- Persistent `unsafe` badge on the terminal.
- Activity history records that permission checks were disabled.
- UI language must explain that this is intended only for isolated or disposable environments.

## Conversation history

Local archive sources:

- Codex: `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`
- Claude: `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`

Conversations are associated with a project by working directory. The indexer:

- Reads provider archives without modifying them.
- Caches parsed files by mtime and size.
- Produces normalized user/assistant messages.
- Searches title, working directory, and complete message content.
- Returns snippets and match counts.
- Highlights query matches in the selected conversation.

Known scaling limitation: search currently scans the in-memory parsed conversations. If archives become large, introduce a SQLite FTS index with file mtime/version tracking rather than repeatedly parsing every archive.

## File and repository behavior

- Local file operations are bounded to the project folder.
- Remote file operations execute through SSH.
- Choosing a folder for a new SSH project browses that host's filesystem, starts at the remote home directory, and stores the canonical remote path. It must never open the local native folder dialog.
- File previews are truncated at 1 MB.
- File previews use a locally bundled Monaco editor in read-only mode with language detection. Writing and saving files is not implemented.
- Terminal links recognize path-like text and optional line/column suffixes.
- Relative terminal links resolve against the project folder.
- Repository URLs are currently auto-discovered only for local projects.
- The project context menu opens the repository when one is available.

## Adding another project type

This is the most important extension point. Do not add a large `if (project.type === ...)` chain throughout `App.tsx`. The current single-type implementation is compact but should be refactored into a project-type registry before implementing writing projects.

### Target model

Separate three concepts:

1. **Base project identity**
   - `id`
   - `type`
   - `name`
   - timestamps
   - optional connection/location identity

2. **Type-owned data and behavior**
   - Stored in a type-specific table.
   - Read and mutated through a type-specific service.
   - Rendered by a type-specific workspace component.

3. **Reusable capabilities**
   - Files
   - Repository
   - Terminals
   - Agent history
   - Search

A project type selects capabilities; a capability should not be hard-coded as belonging to only one type. For example, a future writing project might still optionally use Files or an agent terminal.

### Recommended registry

Introduce a renderer registry with a shape similar to:

```ts
interface ProjectTypeDefinition {
  id: ProjectType;
  label: string;
  description: string;
  capabilities: Array<'terminal' | 'files' | 'repository' | 'agent-history'>;
  Workspace: React.ComponentType<ProjectWorkspaceProps>;
  createFields: ProjectCreateFieldDefinition[];
}
```

Use the registry for:

- The top-bar project-type switcher.
- New-project form fields.
- Project workspace dispatch.
- Available tabs and actions.
- Empty states and labels.

Main-process behavior should use a corresponding service registry:

```ts
interface ProjectTypeService {
  type: ProjectType;
  create(base: Project, input: unknown): void;
  delete?(project: Project): void;
  summarize(project: Project): ProjectTypeSummary;
}
```

This prevents the renderer registry from becoming responsible for persistence.

### Concrete implementation sequence

Before adding the second type:

1. Move terminal-specific project content out of `App.tsx` into `TerminalProjectWorkspace.tsx`.
2. Move History and Files panels into reusable capability components.
3. Add the renderer `projectTypeRegistry`.
4. Replace the hard-coded `projectTypes` array and workspace rendering with registry lookups.
5. Add a main-process project-type service registry.
6. Decide whether every project type requires a folder and connection.
   - If not, migrate `projects.folder` and `connection_id` into a generic optional location model.
   - Do not use fake folders or fake local connections for non-location projects.
7. Add a type-specific table and migration.
8. Extend `ProjectType` in `src/shared/types.ts`.
9. Add type-specific IPC methods and mirror them through preload and renderer declarations.
10. Add type-aware creation validation.
11. Add focused tests for creation, reload, switching, and deletion.

### Writing project example

A writing project should not be implemented as a terminal project with different labels. A reasonable first model is:

```text
writing_projects
  project_id       PRIMARY KEY -> projects.id
  document_root    nullable path or workspace identifier
  primary_document nullable document id
  workflow_state   idea | outlining | drafting | revising | complete
  settings_json
```

Potential writing workspace capabilities:

- Outline
- Draft editor
- Research/source library
- Revision history
- Agent conversations
- Optional Files and Terminal tabs when the project is location-backed

Questions that require owner input before implementing writing projects:

- Is a writing project always backed by a local/remote folder, or can it live entirely in PanePilot?
- Is the primary unit one document, a collection, or both?
- Should drafts be plain Markdown files, database records, or user-selectable?
- Should writing-agent history use Codex/Claude terminal sessions, an API integration, or both?
- Which sidebar state replaces terminal-centric states for writing workflows?

Do not implement the writing type until these decisions are answered.

## Known gaps and future work

- Index Codex and Claude archives over SSH.
- Refactor `App.tsx` and the single CSS file into project-type/capability modules.
- Add formal unit and integration tests.
- Add SQLite FTS when conversation volume warrants it.
- Add packaged-app-safe hook installation; the current hook command references the development checkout.
- Add project deletion and connection health diagnostics.
- Improve remote repository discovery.
- Decide and implement the writing project model.

## Development and validation

Install and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Validation:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
git diff --check
```

`node-pty` requires its native macOS `spawn-helper` to be executable. npm can reinstall the prebuilt helper without its executable bit, which surfaces as the otherwise opaque `posix_spawnp failed` error before any shell starts. `postinstall`, `predev`, and `prestart` run `scripts/prepare-node-pty.mjs`; keep all three guards.

When main-process code changes, stop and restart `npm run dev`; Vite hot reload alone does not restart Electron's main process. Newly injected tmux environment variables only apply to newly created sessions.

## Change checklist

For any change:

1. Preserve local and remote connection behavior.
2. Check whether it is base-project behavior, type-specific behavior, or a reusable capability.
3. Keep provider lifecycle state separate from terminal-process existence.
4. Keep `needs-input` sticky until a real response/continuation.
5. Avoid destructive actions without confirmation and stopped-session validation.
6. Update shared types, main IPC, preload, renderer declarations, and UI together.
7. Add a forward-compatible SQLite migration.
8. Run typecheck, build, and focused smoke tests.
9. Restart Electron for main/preload changes.
10. Commit and push validated scoped changes automatically.

The repository uses npm and tracks `package-lock.json`. Do not add the unrelated `pnpm-lock.yaml` unless the owner intentionally switches package managers.
